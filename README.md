# Me
Contains an html page named "Me.html". 
Couldn't host my website for free,
Click on "view code"
Open "Me.html"
So, kindly do copy paste the code in notepad, and save it with .html extension.
Also paste the 2 pictures in the same folser where u pasted the html file.
Then u can run it :)
Thank you
Sorry for the inconvenience :)
